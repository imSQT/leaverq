# leaverqremover
instructions on how to remove leaverq (somewhat inconsistent, im not sure what the conditions are to remove 100%)

Step 1: Force close client, you can also end the league client and riot client in task manager)

Step 2: Log into another account, maybe one without leaverq penalties

Step 3: Start a queue in all four regular modes (Blind, Draft, Solo, Flex)

Step 4: Log back in to account that had leaver penalties

Step 5: Queue blind pick
